/*Challenge set by Mubashir Hassan*/
/*An employee working at a very bizzare company, earns one penny on their first day. 
However, for every day that passes, their base amount doubles, so they earn two pennies 
on the second day and four pennies on the third day (totalling 7 pennies). Given a 
number of days, return how many pennies the employee accumulates.*/


unsigned int doubledPay(unsigned int n)
{
	  int pay = 1;
    int amount = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
    {
        pay = pay * 2;
        amount = amount + pay;
    }
	
	return amount;

}
