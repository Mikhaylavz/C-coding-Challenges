/*
Create a function to find only the root value of x in any quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c. The function will take three arguments:

a as the coefficient of x^2
b as the coefficient of x
c as the constant term
Examples
quadraticEquation(1, 2, -3) ➞ 1

quadraticEquation(2, -7, 3) ➞ 3

quadraticEquation(1, -12, -28) ➞ 14 */

#include <cmath>

int quadraticEquation(int a, int b, int c) {
	
	float x;
	x = sqrt((b * b) - (4 * a * c));
	x = -b + x;
	x = x / (2 * a);
	printf("%f",x);
}
